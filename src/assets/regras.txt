There are five columns on the board for you to place your cards on. 
You must place cards into these columns to make a total of 21. 
When the cards in the column total up to 21, the column is cleared and you are awarded points. 
You start the game with a pack of 52 cards. 
Click the arrow at the top of each column to place a card in that column. 
Most of the cards are labelled with their value, 
but some cards are not - the Jack, Queen and King (known as the 'face cards') and the Ace.

Bonus Moves
When you complete a column, you are awarded with 10 points. 
However, there are several special moves which will earn you bonus points.

Blackjack
A blackjack is worth 21 points, and can be accomplished by reaching 21 using only a 
10, Jack, Queen or King and an Ace.

Large 21
A large 21 is worth 15 points, and requires 4 or 5 cards totaling 21.

7-7-7
A large 7-7-7 is worth 15 points, and (not surprisingly) requires three '7' cards in a row.

6-7-8
A large 6-7-8 is worth 15 points, and (again, not surprisingly) requires a '6', '7' and '8'.

5 Under 21
Worth only 5 points, you receive this if you end up with 5 cards under 21.
